title: Unsupervised Stain Decomposition via Inversion Regulation for Multiplex Immunohistochemistry
  Images
abstract: Multiplex Immunohistochemistry (mIHC) is a cost-effective and accessible
  method for in situ labeling of multiple protein biomarkers in a tissue sample. By
  assigning a different stain to each biomarker, it allows the visualization of different
  types of cells within the tumor vicinity for downstream analysis. However, to detect
  different types of stains in a given mIHC image is a challenging problem, especially
  when the number of stains is high. Previous deep-learning-based methods mostly assume
  full supervision; yet the annotation can be costly. In this paper, we propose a
  novel unsupervised stain decomposition method to detect different stains simultaneously.
  Our method does not require any supervision, except for color samples of different
  stains. A main technical challenge is that the problem is underdetermined and can
  have multiple solutions. To conquer this issue, we propose a novel inversion regulation
  technique, which eliminates most undesirable solutions. On a 7-plexed IHC image
  dataset, the proposed method achieves high quality stain decomposition results without
  human annotation.
