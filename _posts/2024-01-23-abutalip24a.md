title: Improving Stain Invariance of CNNs for Segmentation by Fusing Channel Attention
  and Domain-Adversarial Training
abstract: Variability in staining protocols, such as different slide preparation techniques,
  chemicals, and scanner configurations, can result in a diverse set of whole slide
  images (WSIs). This distribution shift can negatively impact the performance of
  deep learning models on unseen samples, presenting a significant challenge for developing
  new computational pathology applications. In this study, we propose a method for
  improving the generalizability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to stain
  changes in a single-source setting for semantic segmentation. Recent studies indicate
  that style features mainly exist as covariances in earlier network layers. We design
  a channel attention mechanism based on these findings that detects stain-specific
  features and modify the previously proposed stain-invariant training scheme. We
  reweigh the outputs of earlier layers and pass them to the stain-adversarial training
  branch. We evaluate our method on multi-center, multi-stain datasets and demonstrate
  its effectiveness through interpretability analysis. Our approach achieves substantial
  improvements over baselines and competitive performance compared to other methods,
  as measured by various evaluation metrics. We also show that combining our method
  with stain augmentation leads to mutually beneficial results and outperforms other
  techniques. Overall, our study makes significant contributions to the field of computational
  pathology.
