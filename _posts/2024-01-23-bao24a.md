title: Alleviating tiling effect by random walk sliding window in high-resolution
  histological whole slide image synthesis
abstract: Multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) is an advanced molecular imaging technique
  that can simultaneously provide biologists with multiple (i.e., more than 20) molecular
  markers on a single histological tissue section. Unfortunately, due to imaging restrictions,
  the more routinely used hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is typically unavailable
  with MxIF on the same tissue section. As biological H&E staining is not feasible,
  previous efforts have been made to obtain H&E whole slide image (WSI) from MxIF
  via deep learning empowered virtual staining. However, the tiling effect is a long-lasting
  problem in high-resolution WSI-wise synthesis. The MxIF to H&E synthesis is no exception.
  Limited by computational resources, the cross-stain image synthesis is typically
  performed at the patch-level. Thus, discontinuous intensities might be visually
  identified along with the patch boundaries assembling all individual patches back
  to a WSI. In this work, we propose a deep learning based unpaired high-resolution
  image synthesis method to obtain virtual H&E WSIs from MxIF WSIs (each with 27 markers/stains)
  with reduced tiling effects. Briefly, we first extend the CycleGAN framework by
  adding simultaneous nuclei and mucin segmentation supervision as spatial constraints.
  Then, we introduce a random sliding window shifting strategy during the optimized
  inference stage to alleviate the tiling effects. The validation results show that
  our spatially constrained synthesis method achieves a 56% performance gain for the
  downstream cell segmentation task. The proposed inference method reduces the tiling
  effects by using 50% fewer computation resources without compromising performance.
  The proposed random sliding window inference method is a plug-and-play module, which
  can be generalized and used for other high-resolution WSI image synthesis applications.
