title: Automatic Patient-level Diagnosis of Prostate Disease with Fused 3D MRI and
  Tabular Clinical Data
abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems for automatic prostate cancer diagnosis
  can provide radiologists with decision support during image reading. However, in
  this case, patient-relevant information often remains unexploited due to the greater
  focus on the image recognition side, with various imaging devices and modalities,
  while omitting other potentially valuable clinical data. Therefore, our work investigates
  the performance of recent methods for the fusion of rich image data and heterogeneous
  tabular data. Those data may include patient demographics as well as laboratory
  data, e.g., prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Experiments on the large dataset (3800
  subjects) indicated that when using the fusion method with demographic data in clinically
  significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection tasks, the mean area under the receiver
  operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) has improved significantly from 0.736 to
  0.765. We also observed that the na√Øve concatenation performs similarly or even
  better than the \mbox{state-of-the-art} fusion modules. We also achieved better
  prediction quality in grading prostate disease by including more samples from longitudinal
  PSA profiles in the tabular feature set. Thus, by including the three last PSA samples
  per patient, the best-performing model has reached AUC of 0.794 and a quadratic
  weighted kappa score (QWK) of 0.464, which constitutes a significant improvement
  compared with the image-only method, with ROC AUC of 0.736 and QWK of 0.342.
