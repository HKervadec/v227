title: Patched Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI
abstract: The use of supervised deep learning techniques to detect pathologies in
  brain MRI scans can be challenging due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the
  need for annotated data sets. An alternative approach is to use unsupervised anomaly
  detection, which only requires sample-level labels of healthy brains to create a
  reference representation. This reference representation can then be compared to
  unhealthy brain anatomy in a pixel-wise manner to identify abnormalities. To accomplish
  this, generative models are needed to create anatomically consistent MRI scans of
  healthy brains. While recent diffusion models have shown promise in this task, accurately
  generating the complex structure of the human brain remains a challenge. In this
  paper, we propose a method that reformulates the generation task of diffusion models
  as a patch-based estimation of healthy brain anatomy, using spatial context to guide
  and improve reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on data of tumors and multiple
  sclerosis lesions and demonstrate a relative improvement of 25.1% compared to existing
  baselines.
