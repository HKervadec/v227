title: 'Generalizing Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Towards Unbiased Pathology Screening'
abstract: 'The main benefit of unsupervised anomaly detection is the ability to identify
  arbitrary, rare data instances of pathologies even in the absence of training labels
  or sufficient examples of the rare class(es). In the clinical workflow, such methods
  have the potential to assist in screening and pre-filtering exams for potential
  pathologies and thus meaningfully support radiologists. Even though much work has
  been done on using auto-encoders (AE) for anomaly detection, there are still two
  critical challenges to overcome: First, learning compact and detailed representations
  of the healthy distribution is cumbersome. Recent work shows that AEs can reconstruct
  some types of anomalies even better than actual samples from the training distribution.
  Second, while the majority of unsupervised algorithms are tailored to detect hyperintense
  lesions on FLAIR brain MR scans, recent improvements in basic intensity thresholding
  techniques have outperformed them. Moreover, we found that even state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) AEs fail to detect several classes of non-hyperintense anomalies on T1w brain
  MRIs, such as brain atrophy, edema, or resections. In this work, we propose reversed
  AEs (RA) to generate pseudo-healthy reconstructions and localize various brain pathologies.
  We extensively evaluate our method on T1w brain scans and increase the detection
  of global pathology and artefacts from 73.1 to 89.4 AUROC and the amount of detected
  local pathologies from 52.6% to 86.0% compared to SOTA methods.'
