title: 'DRIMET: Deep Registration-based 3D Incompressible Motion Estimation in Tagged-MRI
  with Application to the Tongue'
abstract: Tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for decades to observe
  and quantify the detailed motion of deforming tissue. However, this technique faces
  several challenges such as tag fading, large motion, long computation times, and
  difficulties in obtaining diffeomorphic incompressible flow fields. To address these
  issues, this paper presents a novel unsupervised phase-based 3D motion estimation
  technique for tagged MRI. We introduce two key innovations. First, we apply a sinusoidal
  transformation to the harmonic phase input, which enables end-to-end training and
  avoids the need for phase interpolation. Second, we propose a Jacobian determinant-based
  learning objective to encourage incompressible flow fields for deforming biological
  tissues. Our method efficiently estimates 3D motion fields that are accurate, dense,
  and approximately diffeomorphic and incompressible. The efficacy of the method is
  assessed using human tongue motion during speech, and includes both healthy controls
  and patients that have undergone glossectomy. We show that the method outperforms
  existing approaches, and also exhibits improvements in speed, robustness to tag
  fading, and large tongue motion. The code is available.
