title: Convolutional-recurrent neural networks approximate diffusion tractography
  from T1-weighted MRI and associated anatomical context
abstract: 'Diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography is the gold-standard for in
  vivo estimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. However, the high angular
  resolution dMRI acquisitions capable of fitting the microstructural models needed
  for tractography are often time-consuming and not routinely collected clinically,
  restricting the scope of tractography analyses. To address this limitation, we build
  on recent advances in deep learning which have demonstrated that streamline propagation
  can be learned from dMRI directly without traditional model fitting. Specifically,
  we propose learning the streamline propagator from T1w MRI to facilitate arbitrary
  tractography analyses when dMRI is unavailable. To do so, we present a novel convolutional-recurrent
  neural network (CoRNN) trained in a teacher-student framework that leverages T1w
  MRI, associated anatomical context, and streamline memory from data acquired for
  the Human Connectome Project. We characterize our approach under two common tractography
  paradigms, WM bundle analysis and structural connectomics, and find approximately
  a 5-15% difference between measures computed from streamlines generated with our
  approach and those generated using traditional dMRI tractography. When placed in
  the literature, these results suggest that the accuracy of WM measures computed
  from T1w MRI with our method is on the level of scan-rescan dMRI variability and
  raise an important question: is tractography truly a microstructural phenomenon,
  or has dMRI merely facilitated its discovery and implementation?'
