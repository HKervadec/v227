title: 'DBGSL: Dynamic Brain Graph Structure Learning'
abstract: Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown success at learning representations
  of brain graphs derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
  The majority of existing GNN methods, however, assume brain graphs are static over
  time and the graph adjacency matrix is known prior to model training. These assumptions
  are at odds with neuroscientific evidence that brain graphs are time-varying with
  a connectivity structure that depends on the choice of functional connectivity measure.
  Noisy brain graphs that do not truly represent the underling fMRI data can have
  a detrimental impact on the performance of GNNs. As a solution, we propose Dynamic
  Brain Graph Structure Learning (DBGSL), a novel method for learning the optimal
  time-varying dependency structure of fMRI data induced by a downstream prediction
  task. Experiments demonstrate DBGSL achieves state-of-the-art performance for sex
  classification using real-world resting-state and task fMRI data. Moreover, analysis
  of the learnt dynamic graphs highlights prediction-related brain regions which align
  with existing neuroscience literature.
