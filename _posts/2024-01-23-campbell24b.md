title: 'DBGDGM: Dynamic Brain Graph Deep Generative Model'
abstract: Graphs are a natural representation of brain activity derived from functional
  magnetic imaging (fMRI) data. It is well known that clusters of anatomical brain
  regions, known as functional connectivity networks (FCNs), encode temporal relationships
  which can serve as useful biomarkers for understanding brain function and dysfunction.
  Previous works, however, ignore the temporal dynamics of the brain and focus on
  static graphs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic brain graph deep generative model
  (DBGDGM) which simultaneously clusters brain regions into temporally evolving communities
  and learns dynamic unsupervised node embeddings. Specifically, DBGDGM represents
  brain graph nodes as embeddings sampled from a distribution over communities that
  evolve over time. We parameterise this community distribution using neural networks
  that learn from subject and node embeddings as well as past community assignments.
  Experiments demonstrate DBGDGM outperforms baselines in graph generation, dynamic
  link prediction, and is comparable for graph classification. Finally, an analysis
  of the learnt community distributions reveals overlap with known FCNs reported in
  neuroscience literature.
