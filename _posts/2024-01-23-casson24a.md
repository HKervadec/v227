title: Joint Breast Neoplasm Detection and Subtyping using Multi-Resolution Network
  Trained on Large-Scale H&E Whole Slide Images with Weak Labels
abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the use of artificial
  intelligence (AI) to help diagnose the disease from digital pathology images has
  the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes. However, current methods for
  detecting, segmenting, and sub-typing breast neoplasms and other proliferative lesions
  often rely on costly and time-consuming manual annotation efforts, which can be
  impractical for large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose an annotation-free
  learning framework to jointly detect, segment, and subtype breast neoplasms. Our
  approach leverages top-k multiple instance learning to train an initial neoplasm
  detection backbone network from weakly-labeled whole slide images, which is then
  used to automatically generate pixel-level pseudo-labels for whole slides with only
  one subtype. A second network is trained using these pseudo-labels, and slide-level
  classification is performed by training an aggregator network that fuses the embeddings
  from both backbone networks. We trained and validated our framework on large-scale
  datasets with more than 100k whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness
  on tasks including breast neoplasms detection, segmentation, and subtyping.
