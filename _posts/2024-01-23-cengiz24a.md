title: 'FUSQA: Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality Assessment'
abstract: Deep learning models have been effective for various fetal ultrasound segmentation
  tasks. However, generalization to new unseen data has raised questions about their
  effectiveness for clinical adoption. Normally, a transition to new unseen data requires
  time-consuming and costly quality assurance processes to validate the segmentation
  performance post-transition. Segmentation quality assessment efforts have focused
  on natural images, where the problem has been typically formulated as a dice score
  regression task. In this paper, we propose a simplified Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation
  Quality Assessment (FUSQA) model to tackle the segmentation performance deterioration
  challenge. We formulate the segmentation quality assessment process as an automated
  classification task to distinguish between good and poor quality segmentation masks
  for more accurate gestational age estimation. We validate the performance of our
  proposed approach on two datasets we collect from two hospitals using different
  ultrasound machines. We compare different architectures, with our best-performing
  architecture achieving over 90% classification accuracy on distinguishing between
  good and poor quality segmentation masks from an unseen dataset. Additionally, there
  was only a 1.45-days difference between the gestational age reported by doctors
  and estimated based on CRL measurements using well-segmented masks. On the other
  hand, this difference increased and reached up to 7.73 days when we calculated CRL
  from the poorly segmented masks. As a result, AI-based approaches can potentially
  aid fetal ultrasound segmentation quality assessment and might detect poor segmentation
  in real-time screening in the future.
