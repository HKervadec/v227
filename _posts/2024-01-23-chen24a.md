title: 'Making Your First Choice: To Address Cold Start Problem in Medical Active
  Learning'
abstract: 'Active learning promises to improve annotation efficiency by iteratively
  selecting the most important data to be annotated first. However, we uncover a striking
  contradiction to this promise: at the first few choices, active learning fails to
  select data as efficiently as random selection. We identify this as the cold start
  problem in active learning, caused by a biased and outlier initial query. This paper
  seeks to address the cold start problem and develops a novel active querying strategy,
  named HaCon, that can exploit the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1)
  no annotation is required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate
  bias; (3) typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers.
  Experiments on three public medical datasets show that HaCon not only significantly
  outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection
  by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/liangyuch/CSVAL.'
