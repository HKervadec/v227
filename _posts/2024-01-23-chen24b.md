title: Model Adaptive Tooth Segmentation
abstract: 'Automatic 3-dimensional tooth segmentation on intraoral scans (IOS) plays
  a pivotal role in computer-aided orthodontic treatments. In practice, deploying
  existing well-trained models to different medical centers suffers from two main
  problems: (1) the data distribution shifts between existing and new centers, (2)
  the data in the existing center is usually not allowed to share while annotating
  additional data in the new center is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper,
  we propose a Model Adaptive Tooth Segmentation (MATS) framework to alleviate these
  issues. Taking the trained model from a source center as input, MATS adapts it to
  different target centers without data transmission or additional annotations, as
  inspired by the source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA) paradigm. The model adaptation
  in MATS is realized by a tooth-level feature prototype learning module, a progressive
  pseudo-labeling module and a tooth-prior regularized information maximization loss.
  Experiments on a dataset with tooth abnormalities and a real-world cross-center
  dataset show that MATS can consistently surpass existing baselines. The effectiveness
  is further verified with extensive ablation studies and statistical analysis, demonstrating
  its applicability for privacy-preserving tooth segmentation in real-world digital
  dentistry.'
