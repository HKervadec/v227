title: A comparison of self-supervised pretraining approaches for predicting disease
  risk from chest radiograph images
abstract: Deep learning is the state-of-the-art for medical imaging tasks, but requires
  large, labeled datasets. For risk prediction, large datasets are rare since they
  require both imaging and follow-up (e.g., diagnosis codes). However, the release
  of publicly available imaging data with diagnostic labels presents an opportunity
  for self and semi-supervised approaches to improve label efficiency for risk prediction.
  Though several studies have compared self-supervised approaches in natural image
  classification, object detection, and medical image interpretation, there is limited
  data on which approaches learn robust representations for risk prediction. We present
  a comparison of semi- and self-supervised learning to predict mortality risk using
  chest x-ray images. We find that a semi-supervised autoencoder outperforms contrastive
  and transfer learning in internal and external validation.
