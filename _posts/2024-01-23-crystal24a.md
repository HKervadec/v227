title: Domain Adaptation using Silver Standard Masks for Lateral Ventricle Segmentation
  in FLAIR MRI
abstract: 'Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) is an important biomarker for clinical
  investigation. We present the first transfer learning-based LVV segmentation method
  for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. To mitigate covariate shifts
  between source and target domains, this work proposes an domain adaptation method
  that optimizes performance on three target datasets. Silver standard (SS) masks
  were generated from the target domain using a novel conventional image processing
  ventricular segmentation algorithm and used to supplement the gold standard (GS)
  data from the source domain, Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN). Four
  models were tested on held-out test sets from four datasets: 1) SS+GS: trained on
  target SS masks and fine-tuned on source GS masks, 2) GS+SS: trained on source GS
  masks and fine-tuned on target SS masks, 3) trained on source GS (GS CAIN Only)
  and 4) trained on target SS masks (SS Only). The SS+GS model had the best and most
  consistent performance (mean DSC = 0.89, CoV = 0.05) and showed significantly p
  < 0.05) higher DSC compared to the GS-only model on three target domains. Results
  suggest pre-training with noisy labels from the target domain allows the model to
  adapt to the dataset-specific characteristics and provides robust parameter initialization
  while fine-tuning with GS masks allows the model to learn detailed features. This
  method has wide application to other medical imaging problems where labeled data
  is scarce, and can be used as a per-dataset calibration method to accelerate wide-scale
  adoption.'
