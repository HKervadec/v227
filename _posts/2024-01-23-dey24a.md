title: 'MTSR-MRI: Combined Modality Translation and Super-Resolution of Magnetic Resonance
  Images'
abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common non-invasive imaging technique
  with high soft tissue contrast. Different MRI modalities are used for the diagnosis
  of various conditions including T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI. In this paper,
  we introduce MTSR-MRI, a novel method that can not only upscale low-resolution scans
  but also translates between the T1-weighted and T2-weighted modalities. This will
  potentially reduce the scan time or repeat scans by taking low-resolution inputs
  in one modality and returning plausible high-resolution output in another modality.
  Due to the ambiguity that persists in image-to-image translation tasks, we consider
  the distribution of possible outputs in a conditional generative setting. The mapping
  is distilled in a low-dimensional latent distribution which can be randomly sampled
  at test time, thus allowing us to generate multiple plausible high-resolution outputs
  from a given low-resolution input. We validate the proposed method on the BraTS-18
  dataset qualitatively and quantitatively using a variety of similarity measures.
