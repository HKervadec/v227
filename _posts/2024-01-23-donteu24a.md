title: Sparse Activations for Interpretable Disease Grading
abstract: Interpreting deep learning models typically relies on post-hoc saliency
  map techniques. However, these techniques often fail to serve as actionable feedback
  to clinicians, and they do not directly explain the decision mechanism. Here, we
  propose an inherently interpretable model that combines the feature extraction capabilities
  of deep neural networks with advantages of sparse linear models in interpretability.
  Our approach relies on straightforward but effective changes to a deep bag-of-local-features
  model (BagNet). These modifications lead to fine-grained and sparse class evidence
  maps which, by design, correctly reflect the model’s decision mechanism. Our model
  is particularly suited for tasks which rely on characterising regions of interests
  that are very small and distributed over the image. In this paper, we focus on the
  detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, which is characterised by the progressive presence
  of small retinal lesions on fundus images. We observed good classification accuracy
  despite our added sparseness constraint. In addition, our model precisely highlighted
  retinal lesions relevant for the disease grading task and excluded irrelevant regions
  from the decision mechanism. The results suggest our sparse BagNet model can be
  a useful tool for clinicians as it allows efficient inspection of the model predictions
  and facilitates clinicians’ and patients’ trust.
