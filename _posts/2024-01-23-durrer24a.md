title: Diffusion Models for Contrast Harmonization of Magnetic Resonance Images
abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) images from multiple sources often show differences
  in image contrast related to acquisition settings or the used scanner type. For
  long-term studies, longitudinal comparability is essential but can be impaired by
  these contrast differences, leading to biased results when using automated evaluation
  tools. This study presents a diffusion model-based approach for contrast harmonization.
  We use a data set consisting of scans of 18 Multiple Sclerosis patients and 22 healthy
  controls. Each subject was scanned in two MR scanners of different magnetic field
  strengths (1.5 T and 3 T), resulting in a paired data set that shows scanner-inherent
  differences. We map images from the source contrast to the target contrast for both
  directions, from 3 T to 1.5 T and from 1.5 T to 3 T. As we only want to change the
  contrast, not the anatomical information, our method uses the original image to
  guide the image-to-image translation process by adding structural information. The
  aim is that the mapped scans display increased comparability with scans of the target
  contrast for downstream tasks. We evaluate this method for the task of segmentation
  of cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter and white matter. Our method achieves good and
  consistent results for both directions of the mapping.
