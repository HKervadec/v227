title: Domain Adaptation using Silver Standard Labels for Ki-67 Scoring in Digital
  Pathology A Step Closer to Widescale Deployment
abstract: 'Deep learning systems have been proposed to improve the objectivity and
  efficiency of Ki-67 PI scoring. The challenge is that deep learning techniques,
  while very accurate, suffer from reduced performance when applied to out-of-domain
  data. This is a critical challenge for clinical translation, as models are typically
  trained using data available to the vendor, which is not from the target domain.
  To address this challenge, this study proposes a domain adaptation pipeline that
  employs an unsupervised framework to generate silver standard (pseudo) labels in
  the target domain, which is used to augment the gold standard (GS) source domain
  data. Five training regimes were tested on two validated Ki-67 scoring architectures
  (UV-Net and piNET), (1) SS Only: trained on target silver standard (SS) labels,
  (2) GS Only: trained on source GS labels, (3) Mixed: trained on target SS and source
  GS labels, (4) GS+SS: trained on source GS labels and fine-tuned on target SS labels,
  and our proposed method (5) SS+GS: trained on source SS labels and fine-tuned on
  source GS labels. The SS+GS method yielded significantly ($p<0.05$) higher PI accuracy
  ($95.9%$) and more consistent results compared to the GS Only model on target data.
  Analysis of t-SNE plots showed features learned by the SS+GS models are more aligned
  for source and target data which results in improved generalization. The proposed
  pipeline provides an efficient method for learning the target distribution without
  the need for manual annotations, which are time-consuming and costly to generate
  for medical images. This framework can be applied to any target site as a per-laboratory
  calibration method, for widescale deployment.'
