title: E(3) x SO(3)-Equivariant Networks for Spherical Deconvolution in Diffusion
  MRI
abstract: We present Roto-Translation Equivariant Spherical Deconvolution (RT-ESD),
  an $E(3)\times SO(3)$ equivariant framework for sparse deconvolution of volumes
  where each voxel contains a spherical signal. Such 6D data naturally arises in diffusion
  MRI (dMRI), a medical imaging modality widely used to measure microstructure and
  structural connectivity. As each dMRI voxel is typically a mixture of various overlapping
  structures, there is a need for blind deconvolution to recover crossing anatomical
  structures such as white matter tracts. Existing dMRI work takes either an iterative
  or deep learning approach to sparse spherical deconvolution, yet it typically does
  not account for relationships between neighboring measurements. This work constructs
  equivariant deep learning layers which respect to symmetries of spatial rotations,
  reflections, and translations, alongside the symmetries of voxelwise spherical rotations.
  As a result, RT-ESD improves on previous work across several tasks including fiber
  recovery on the DiSCo dataset, deconvolution-derived partial volume estimation on
  real-world in vivo human brain dMRI, and improved downstream reconstruction of fiber
  tractograms on the Tractometer dataset. The code will be released.
