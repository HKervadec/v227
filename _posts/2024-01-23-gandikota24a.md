title: Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Low dose CT Recovery
abstract: Low dose computer tomography (CT) acquisition using reduced radiation or
  sparse angle measurements is recommended to decrease the harmful effects of X-ray
  radiation. Recent works successfully apply deep networks to the problem of low dose
  CT recovery on benchmark datasets. However, their robustness needs a thorough evaluation
  before use in clinical settings. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of different
  deep learning approaches and classical methods for CT recovery.We show that deep
  networks, including model based networks encouraging data consistency are more susceptible
  to untargeted attacks. Surprisingly, we observe that data consistency is not heavily
  affected even for these poor quality reconstructions, motivating the need for better
  regularization for the networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of universal attacks
  and study attack transferability across different methods. We analyze robustness
  to attacks causing localized changes in clinically relevant regions. Both classical
  approaches and deep networks are affected by such attacks leading to change in visual
  appearance of localized lesions, for extremely small perturbations. As the resulting
  reconstructions have high data consistency with original measurements, these localized
  attacks can be used to explore the solution space of CT recovery problem.
