title: Learning Clinically Acceptable Segmentation of Organs at Risk in Cervical Cancer
  Radiation Treatment from Clinically Available Annotations
abstract: Deep learning models benefit from training with a large dataset (labeled
  or unlabeled). Following this motivation, we present an approach to learn a deep
  learning model for the automatic segmentation of Organs at Risk (OARs) in cervical
  cancer radiation treatment from a large clinically available dataset of Computed
  Tomography (CT) scans containing data inhomogeneity, label noise, and missing annotations.
  We employ simple heuristics for automatic data cleaning to minimize data inhomogeneity
  and label noise. Further, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach utilizing
  a teacher-student setup, annotation imputation, and uncertainty-guided training
  to learn in presence of missing annotations. Our experimental results show that
  learning from a large dataset with our approach yields a significant improvement
  in the test performance despite missing annotations in the data. Further, the contours
  generated from the segmentation masks predicted by our model are found to be equally
  clinically acceptable as manually generated contours.
