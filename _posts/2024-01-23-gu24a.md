title: Decoding natural image stimuli from fMRI data with a surface-based convolutional
  network
abstract: Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and limited resolution of functional
  MRI data, and the high complexity of natural images, reconstructing a visual stimulus
  from human brain fMRI measurements is a challenging task. In this work, we propose
  a novel approach for this task, which we call Cortex2Image, to decode visual stimuli
  with high semantic fidelity and rich fine-grained detail. In particular, we train
  a surface-based convolutional network model that maps from brain response to semantic
  image features first (Cortex2Semantic). We then combine this model with a high-quality
  image generator (Instance-Conditioned GAN) to train another mapping from brain response
  to fine-grained image features using a variational approach (Cortex2Detail). Image
  reconstructions obtained by our proposed method achieve state-of-the-art semantic
  fidelity, while yielding good fine-grained similarity with the ground-truth stimulus.
