title: 'SuperMask: Generating High-resolution object masks from multi-view, unaligned
  low-resolution MRIs'
abstract: Three-dimensional segmentation in magnetic resonance images (MRI), which
  reflects the true shape of the objects, is challenging since high-resolution isotropic
  MRIs are rare and typical MRIs are anisotropic, with the out-of-plane dimension
  having a much lower resolution. A potential remedy to this issue lies in the fact
  that often multiple sequences are acquired on different planes. However, in practice,
  these sequences are not orthogonal to each other, limiting the applicability of
  many previous solutions to reconstruct higher-resolution images from multiple lower-resolution
  ones. We propose a novel deep learning-based solution to generating high-resolution
  masks from multiple low-resolution images. Our method combines segmentation and
  unsupervised registration networks by introducing two new regularizations to make
  registration and segmentation reinforce each other. Finally, we introduce a multi-view
  fusion method to generate high-resolution target object masks. The experimental
  results on two datasets show the superiority of our methods. Importantly, the advantage
  of not using high-resolution images in the training process makes our method applicable
  to a wide variety of MRI segmentation tasks.
