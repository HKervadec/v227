title: Reference-based MRI Reconstruction Using Texture Transformer
abstract: Deep Learning (DL) based methods for magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction
  have been shown to produce superior performance. However, previous methods either
  only leverage under-sampled data or require a paired fully-sampled auxiliary MR
  sequence to perform guidance-based reconstruction. Consequently, existing approaches
  neglect to explore attention mechanisms that can transfer texture from reference
  data to under-sampled data within a single MR sequence, which either limits the
  performance of these approaches or increases the difficulty of data acquisition.
  In this paper, we propose a novel $\textbf{T}$exture $\textbf{T}$ransformer $\textbf{M}$odule
  ($\textbf{TTM}$) for the reference-based MR image reconstruction. The TTM facilitates
  joint feature learning across under-sampled and reference data, so feature correspondences
  can be discovered by attention and accurate texture features can be leveraged during
  reconstruction. Notably, TTM can be stacked on prior MRI reconstruction methods
  to improve their performance. In addition, a $\textbf{R}$ecurrent $\textbf{T}$ransformer
  $\textbf{R}$econstruction backbone ($\textbf{RTR}$) is proposed to further improve
  the performance in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of TTM and show that RTR can achieve the state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.
  Implementation code and pre-trained weights will be made public after the review
  process.
