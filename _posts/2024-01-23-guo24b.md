title: 'Stage Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment: Region-dependent Graph Representation
  Learning on Brain Morphable Meshes'
abstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as a transitional state between normal
  cognition and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is crucial for taking preventive interventions
  in order to slow down AD progression. Given the high relevance of brain atrophy
  and the neurodegeneration process of AD, we propose a novel mesh-based pooling module,
  RegionPool, to investigate the morphological changes in brain shape regionally.
  We then present a geometric deep learning framework with the RegionPool and graph
  attention convolutions to perform binary classification on MCI subtypes (EMCI/LMCI).
  Our model does not require feature engineering and relies only on the relevant geometric
  information of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. Our evaluation
  reveals the state-of-the-art classification capabilities of our network and shows
  that current empirically derived MCI subtypes cannot identify heterogeneous patterns
  of cortical atrophy at the MCI stage. The class activation maps (CAMs) generated
  from the correct predictions provide additional visual evidence for our model’s
  decisions and are consistent with the atrophy patterns reported by the relevant
  literature.
