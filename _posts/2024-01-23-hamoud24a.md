title: 'ST(OR)$^2$: Spatio-Temporal Object Level Reasoning for Activity Recognition
  in the Operating Room'
abstract: Surgical robotics holds much promise for improving patient safety and clinician
  experience in the Operating Room (OR). However, it also comes with new challenges,
  requiring strong team coordination and effective OR management. Automatic detection
  of surgical activities is a key requirement for developing AI-based intelligent
  tools to tackle these challenges. The current state-of-the-art surgical activity
  recognition methods however operate on image-based representations and depend on
  large-scale labeled datasets whose collection is time-consuming and resource-expensive.
  This work proposes a new sample-efficient and object-based approach for surgical
  activity recognition in the OR. Our method focuses on the geometric arrangements
  between clinicians and surgical devices, thus utilizing the significant object interaction
  dynamics in the OR. We conduct experiments in a low-data regime study for long video
  activity recognition. We also benchmark our method against other object-centric
  approaches on clip-level action classification and show superior performance.
