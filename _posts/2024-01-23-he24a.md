title: Whole-slide-imaging Cancer Metastases Detection and Localization with Limited
  Tumorous Data
abstract: Recently, various deep learning methods have shown significant successes
  in medical image analysis, especially in the detection of cancer metastases in hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). However, in order to obtain good
  performance, these research achievements rely on hundreds of well-annotated WSIs.
  In this study, we tackle the tumor localization and detection problem under the
  setting of few labeled whole slide images and introduce a patch-based analysis pipeline
  based on the latest reverse knowledge distillation architecture. To address the
  extremely unbalanced normal and tumorous samples in training sample collection,
  we applied the focal loss formula to the representation similarity metric for model
  optimization. Compared with prior arts, our method achieves similar performance
  by less than ten percent of training samples on the public Camelyon16 dataset. In
  addition, this is the first work that show the great potential of the knowledge
  distillation models in computational histopathology. Our python implementation will
  be publically accessible upon paper acceptance.
