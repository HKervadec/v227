title: Generative Adversarial Networks for Coronary CT Angiography Acquisition Protocol
  Correction with Explicit Attenuation Constraints
abstract: The image quality of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is important for the
  correct diagnosis of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, which is heavily
  influenced by image acquisition. Timing of the contrast media injection specifically
  influences the level of arterial enhancement, and it is aimed to allow optimal assessment
  of the coronary artery morphology. However, a consensus on an optimal acquisition
  protocol that can account for the large variety in patient cohorts has not been
  reached, commonly resulting in suboptimal arterial enhancement. In this work, we
  propose a generative adversarial network for the retrospective correction of contrast
  media attenuation in CCTA, thus reducing the dependency on an optimal timing protocol
  at acquisition. We develop and evaluate the method in a set of 1,179 CCTA scans
  with varying levels of contrast enhancement. We evaluate the consistency of intensity
  values in the coronary arteries and evaluate performance of coronary centerline
  extraction as a commonly performed analysis task. Results show that correction of
  contrast media attenuation values in CCTA scans is feasible, and that it improves
  the performance of automatic centerline extraction. The method may allow improved
  analysis of coronary arteries in CCTA scans with suboptimal contrast enhancement.
