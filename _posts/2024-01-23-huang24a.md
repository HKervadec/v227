title: Radiology Reports Improve Visual Representations Learned from Radiographs
abstract: Although human’s ability to visually understand the structure of the World
  plays a crucial role in perceiving the World and making appropriate decisions, human
  perception does not solely rely on vision but amalgamates the information from acoustic,
  verbal, and visual stimuli. An active area of research has been revolving around
  designing an efficient framework that adapts to multiple modalities and ideally
  improves the performance of existing tasks. While numerous frameworks have proved
  effective on natural datasets like ImageNet, a limited number of studies have been
  carried out in the biomedical domain. In this work, we extend the available frameworks
  for natural data to biomedical data by leveraging the abundant, unstructured multi-modal
  data available as radiology images and reports. We attempt to answer the question,
  ”For multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning and joint learning using both
  learning strategies, which one improves the visual representation for downstream
  chest radiographs classification tasks the most?”. Our experiments indicated that
  in limited labeled data settings with 1% and 10% labeled data, the joint learning
  with multi-modal and self-supervised models outperforms self-supervised learning
  and is at par with multi-modal learning. Additionally, we found that multi-modal
  learning is generally more robust on out-of-distribution datasets.
