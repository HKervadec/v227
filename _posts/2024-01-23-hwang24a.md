title: Semi-supervised Learning with Contrastive and Topology Losses for Catheter
  Segmentation and Misplacement Prediction
abstract: Chest X-ray images are often used to determine the proper placement of catheters,
  as incorrect placement can lead to severe complications. With the advent of deep
  learning, computer-aided detection methods have been developed to assist radiologists
  in identifying catheter misplacement by detecting and highlighting the catheterâ€™s
  path. However, obtaining large, pixel-wise labeled datasets can be challenging due
  to the labor-intensive nature of annotation. To address this issue, we proposed
  a novel semi-supervised learning method that combines contrastive loss and topology
  loss. This method takes advantage of the known topological properties of catheters
  and does not require extensive labeling. We collected 7,378 chest X-ray images from
  the *****, which were labeled for misplacement of nasogastric and endotracheal tube
  catheters, and included pixel-wise annotation. Moreover, the CLiP dataset was used
  as an unlabeled dataset for semi-supervised learning. We used a hybrid U-Net architecture
  with an added classification head to perform simultaneous segmentation of the catheter
  and misplacement classification. Our model achieved an average AUC of 0.977 for
  classification and a average Dice score of 0.598 for segmentation.
