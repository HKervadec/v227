title: Multimodal Image-Text Matching Improves Retrieval-based Chest X-Ray Report
  Generation
abstract: 'Automated generation of clinically accurate radiology reports can improve
  patient care. Previous report generation methods that rely on image captioning models
  often generate incoherent and incorrect text due to their lack of relevant domain
  knowledge, while retrieval-based attempts frequently retrieve reports that are irrelevant
  to the input image. In this work, we propose Contrastive X-Ray REport Match (X-REM),
  a novel retrieval-based radiology report generation module that uses an image-text
  matching score to measure the similarity of a chest X-ray image and radiology report
  for report retrieval. We observe that computing the image-text matching score with
  a language-image model can effectively capture the fine-grained interaction between
  image and text that is often lost when using cosine similarity. X-REM outperforms
  multiple prior radiology report generation modules in terms of both natural language
  and clinical metrics. Human evaluation of the generated reports suggests that X-REM
  increased the number of zero-error reports and decreased the average error severity
  compared to the baseline retrieval approach. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rajpurkarlab/X-REM'
