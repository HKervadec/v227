title: 'TransNetR: Transformer-based Residual Network for Polyp Segmentation with
  Multi-Center Out-of-Distribution Testing'
abstract: Colonoscopy is considered the most effective screening test to detect colorectal
  cancer (CRC) and its precursor lesions, i.e., polyps. However, the procedure experiences
  high miss rates due to polyp heterogeneity and inter-observer dependency. Hence,
  several deep learning powered systems have been proposed considering the criticality
  of polyp detection and segmentation in clinical practices. Despite achieving improved
  outcomes, the existing automated approaches are inefficient in attaining real-time
  processing speed. Moreover, they suffer from a significant performance drop when
  evaluated on inter-patient data, especially those collected from different centers.
  Therefore, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep learning based architecture,
  Transformer based Residual network (TransNetR), for colon polyp segmentation and
  evaluate its diagnostic performance. The proposed architecture, TransNetR, is an
  encoder-decoder network that consists of a pre-trained ResNet50 as the encoder,
  three decoder blocks, and an upsampling layer at the end of the network. TransNetR
  obtains a high dice coefficient of 0.8706 and a mean Intersection over union of
  0.8016 and retains a real-time processing speed of 54.60 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset.
  Apart from this, the major contribution of the work lies in exploring the generalizability
  of the TransNetR by testing the proposed algorithm on the out-of-distribution (test
  distribution is unknown and different from training distribution) dataset. As a
  use case, we tested our proposed algorithm on the PolypGen (6 unique centers) dataset
  and two other popular polyp segmentation benchmarking datasets. We obtained state-of-the-art
  performance on all three datasets during out-of-distribution testing. The source
  code of TransNetR is available at https://github.com/Anonymous/TransNetR.
