title: 'CP2Image: Generating high-quality single-cell images using CellProfiler representations'
abstract: Single-cell high-throughput microscopy images contain key biological information
  underlying normal and pathological cellular processes. Image-based analysis and
  profiling are powerful and promising for extracting this information but are made
  difficult due to substantial complexity and heterogeneity in cellular phenotype.
  Hand-crafted methods and machine learning models are popular ways to extract cell
  image information. Representations extracted via machine learning models, which
  often exhibit good reconstruction performance, lack biological interpretability.
  Hand-crafted representations, on the contrary, have clear biological meanings and
  thus are interpretable. Whether these hand-crafted representations can also generate
  realistic images is not clear. In this paper, we propose a CellProfiler to image
  (CP2Image) model that can directly generate realistic cell images from CellProfiler
  representations. We also demonstrate most biological information encoded in the
  CellProfiler representations is well-preserved in the generating process. This is
  the first time hand-crafted representations be shown to have generative ability
  and provide researchers with an intuitive way for their further analysis.
