title: 'Considerations for data acquisition and modeling strategies: Mitosis detection
  in computational pathology'
abstract: Preparing data for machine learning tasks in health and life science applications
  requires decisions that affect the cost, model properties and performance. In this
  work, we study the implication of data collection strategies, focusing on a case
  study of mitosis detection. Specifically, we investigate the use of expert and crowd-sourced
  labelers, the impact of aggregated vs single labels, and the framing of the problem
  as either classification or object detection. Our results demonstrate the value
  of crowd-sourced labels, importance of uncertainty quantification, and utility of
  negative samples.
