title: A Geometric Deep Learning Framework for Generation of Virtual Left Ventricles
  as Graphs
abstract: Generative statistical models have a wide range of applications in the modelling
  of anatomies. In-silico clinical trials of medical devices, for instance, require
  the development of virtual populations of anatomy that capture enough variability
  while remaining plausible. Model construction and use are heavily influenced by
  the correspondence problem and establishing shape matching over a large number of
  training data.This study focuses on generating virtual cohorts of left ventricle
  geometries resembling different-sized shape populations, suitable for in-silico
  experiments. We present an unsupervised data-driven probabilistic generative model
  for shapes. This framework incorporates an attention-based shape matching procedure
  using graph neural networks, coupled with a $\beta-$VAE generation model, eliminating
  the need for initial shape correspondence. Left ventricle shapes derived from cardiac
  magnetic resonance images available in the UK Biobank are utilized for training
  and validating the framework. We investigate our methodâ€™s generative capabilities
  in terms of generalisation and specificity and show that it is able to synthesise
  virtual populations of realistic shapes with volumetric measurements in line with
  actual clinical indices. Moreover, results show our method outperforms joint registration-PCA-based
  models.
