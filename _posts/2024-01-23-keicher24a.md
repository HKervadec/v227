title: 'FlexR: Few-shot Classification with Language Embeddings for Structured Reporting
  of Chest X-rays'
abstract: The automation of chest X-ray reporting has garnered significant interest
  due to the time-consuming nature of the task. However, the clinical accuracy of
  free-text reports has proven challenging to quantify using natural language processing
  metrics, given the complexity of medical information, the variety of writing styles,
  and the potential for typos and inconsistencies. Structured reporting and standardized
  reports, on the other hand, can provide consistency and formalize the evaluation
  of clinical correctness. However, high-quality annotations for structured reporting
  are scarce. Therefore, we propose a method to predict clinical findings defined
  by sentences in structured reporting templates, which can be used to fill such templates.
  The approach involves training a contrastive language-image model using chest X-rays
  and related free-text radiological reports, then creating textual prompts for each
  structured finding and optimizing a classifier to predict clinical findings in the
  medical image. Results show that even with limited image-level annotations for training,
  the method can accomplish the structured reporting tasks of severity assessment
  of cardiomegaly and localizing pathologies in chest X-rays.
