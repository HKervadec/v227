title: Learning to Compare Longitudinal Images
abstract: Longitudinal studies, where a series of images from the same set of individuals
  are acquired at different time-points, represent a popular technique for studying
  and characterizing temporal dynamics in biomedical applications. The classical approach
  for longitudinal comparison involves normalizing for nuisance variations, such as
  image orientation or contrast differences, via pre-processing. Statistical analysis
  is, in turn, conducted to detect changes of interest, either at the individual or
  population level. This classical approach can suffer from pre-processing issues
  and limitations of the statistical modeling. For example, normalizing for nuisance
  variation might be hard in settings where there are a lot of idiosyncratic changes.
  In this paper, we present a simple machine learning-based approach that can alleviate
  these issues. In our approach, we train a deep learning model (called PaIRNet, for
  Pairwise Image Ranking Network) to compare pairs of longitudinal images, with or
  without supervision. In the self-supervised setup, for instance, the model is trained
  to temporally order the images, which requires learning to recognize time-irreversible
  changes. Our results from four datasets demonstrate that PaIRNet can be very effective
  in localizing and quantifying meaningful longitudinal changes while discounting
  nuisance variation. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/heejong-kim/learning-to-compare-longitudinal-images}
