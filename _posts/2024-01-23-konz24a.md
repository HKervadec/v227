title: 'Reverse Engineering Breast MRIs: Predicting Acquisition Parameters Directly
  from Images'
abstract: The image acquisition parameters (IAPs) used to create MRI scans are central
  to defining the appearance of the images. Deep learning models trained on data acquired
  using certain parameters might not generalize well to images acquired with different
  parameters. Being able to recover such parameters directly from an image could help
  determine whether a deep learning model is applicable, and could assist with data
  harmonization and/or domain adaptation. Here, we introduce a neural network model
  that can predict many complex IAPs used to generate an MR image with high accuracy
  solely using the image, with a single forward pass. These predicted parameters include
  field strength, echo and repetition times, acquisition matrix, scanner model, scan
  options, and others. Even challenging parameters such as contrast agent type can
  be predicted with good accuracy. We perform a variety of experiments and analyses
  of our modelâ€™s ability to predict IAPs on many MRI scans of new patients, and demonstrate
  its usage in a realistic application. Predicting IAPs from the images is an important
  step toward better understanding the relationship between image appearance and IAPs.
  This in turn will advance the understanding of many concepts related to the generalizability
  of neural network models on medical images, including domain shift, domain adaptation,
  and data harmonization.
