title: Automatic 3D/2D Deformable Registration in Minimally Invasive Liver Resection
  using a Mesh Recovery Network
abstract: We propose the patient-specific Liver Mesh Recovery (LMR) framework, to
  automatically achieve Augmented Reality (AR) guidance by registering a preoperative
  3D model in Minimally Invasive Liver Resection (MILR). Existing methods solve registration
  in MILR by pose estimation followed with numerical optimisation and suffer from
  a prohibitive intraoperative runtime. The proposed LMR is inspired by the recent
  Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) framework and forms the first learning-based method to
  solve registration in MILR. In contrast to existing methods, the computation load
  in LMR occurs preoperatively, at training time. We construct a patient-specific
  deformation model and generate patient-specific training data reproducing the typical
  defects of the automatically detected registration primitives. Experimental results
  show that LMRâ€™s registration accuracy is on par with optimisation-based methods,
  whilst running in real-time intraoperatively.
