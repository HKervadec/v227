title: Frozen Language Model Helps ECG Zero-Shot Learning
abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used non-invasive,
  convenient medical monitoring tools that assist in the clinical diagnosis of heart
  diseases. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques, particularly self-supervised
  learning (SSL), have demonstrated great potential in the classification of ECGs.
  SSL pre-training has achieved competitive performance with only a small amount of
  annotated data after fine-tuning. However, current SSL methods rely on the availability
  of annotated data and are unable to predict labels not existing in fine-tuning datasets.
  To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{E}CG-\textbf{T}ext
  \textbf{S}elf-supervised pre-training (METS), \textbf{the first work} to utilize
  the auto-generated clinical reports to guide ECG SSL pre-training. We use a trainable
  ECG encoder and a frozen language model to embed paired ECGs and automatically machine-generated
  clinical reports separately, then the ECG embedding and paired report embedding
  are compared with other unpaired embeddings. In downstream classification tasks,
  METS achieves around 10% improvement in performance without using any annotated
  data via zero-shot classification, compared to other supervised and SSL baselines
  that rely on annotated data. Furthermore, METS achieves the highest recall and F1
  scores on the MIT-BIH dataset, despite MIT-BIH containing different classes of ECGs
  compared to the pre-trained dataset. The extensive experiments have demonstrated
  the advantages of using ECG-Text multimodal self-supervised learning in terms of
  generalizability and effectiveness.
