title: Joint cortical registration of geometry and function using semi-supervised
  learning
abstract: Brain surface-based image registration, an important component of brain
  image analysis, establishes spatial correspondence between cortical surfaces. Existing
  iterative and learning-based approaches focus on accurate registration of folding
  patterns of the cerebral cortex, and assume that geometry predicts function and
  thus functional areas will also be well aligned. However, structure/functional variability
  of anatomically corresponding areas across subjects has been widely reported. In
  this work, we introduce a learning-based cortical registration framework, JOSA,
  which jointly aligns folding patterns and functional maps while simultaneously learning
  an optimal atlas. We demonstrate that JOSA can substantially improve registration
  performance in both anatomical and functional domains over existing methods. By
  employing a semi-supervised training strategy, the proposed framework obviates the
  need for functional data during inference, enabling its use in broad neuroscientific
  domains where functional data may not be observed. The source code of JOSA will
  be released to the public at https://voxelmorph.net.
