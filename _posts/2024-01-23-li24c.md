title: Spatial Correspondence between Graph Neural Network-Segmented Images
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed for medical image segmentation,
  by predicting anatomical structures represented by graphs of vertices and edges.
  One such type of graphs are predefined with fixed size and connectivity to represent
  a reference of anatomical regions of interest, thus known as templates. This work
  explores the potentials in these GNNs with common topology for establishing spatial
  correspondence, implicitly maintained during segmenting two or more images. With
  an example application of registering local vertebral sub-regions found in CT images,
  our experimental results showed that the GNN-based segmentation is capable of accurate
  and reliable localisation of the same interventionally interesting structures between
  images, not limited to the segmentation classes. The reported average target registration
  errors of 2.2$\pm$1.3 mm and 2.7$\pm$1.4 mm, for aligning holdout test images with
  a reference and for aligning two test images, respectively, were by a considerable
  margin lower than those from the tested non-learning and learning-based registration
  algorithms. Further ablation studies assess the contributions towards the registration
  performance, from individual components in the originally segmentation-purposed
  network and its training algorithm. The results highlight that the proposed segmentation-in-lieu-of-registration
  approach shares methodological similarity with existing registration methods, such
  as the use of displacement smoothness constraint and point distance minimisation
  albeit on non-grid graphs, which interestingly yielded benefits for both segmentation
  and registration. We therefore conclude that the template-based GNN segmentation
  can effectively establish spatial correspondence in our application, without any
  other dedicated registration algorithms.
