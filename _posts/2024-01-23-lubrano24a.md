title: Simple and Efficient Confidence Score for Grading Whole Slide Images
abstract: 'Grading precancerous lesions on whole slide images is a challenging task:
  the continuous space of morphological phenotypes makes clear-cut decisions between
  different grades often difficult, leading to low inter- and intra-rater agreements.
  More and more Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to help pathologists
  perform and standardize their diagnosis. However, those models can render their
  prediction without consideration of the ambiguity of the classes and can fail without
  notice which prevent their wider acceptance in a clinical context. In this paper,
  we propose a new score to measure the confidence of AI models in grading tasks.
  Our confidence score is specifically adapted to ordinal output variables, is versatile
  and does not require extra training or additional inferences nor particular architecture
  changes. Comparison to other popular techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout and
  deep ensembles shows that our method provides state-of-the art results, while being
  simpler, more versatile and less computationally intensive. The score is also easily
  interpretable and consistent with real life hesitations of pathologists. We show
  that the score is capable of accurately identifying mispredicted slides and that
  accuracy for high confidence decisions is significantly higher than for low-confidence
  decisions (gap in AUC of 17.1% on the test set). We believe that the proposed confidence
  score could be leveraged by pathologists directly in their workflow and assist them
  on difficult tasks such as grading precancerous lesions.'
