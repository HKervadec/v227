title: 'TransRP: Transformer-based PET/CT feature extraction incorporating clinical
  data for recurrence-free survival prediction in oropharyngeal cancer'
abstract: The growing number of subtypes and treatment options for oropharyngeal squamous
  cell carcinoma (OPSCC), a common type of head and neck cancer (HNC), highlights
  the need for personalized therapies. Prognostic outcome prediction models can identify
  different risk groups for investigation of intensified or de-escalated treatment
  strategies. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to have improved
  predictive performance compared to traditional clinical and radiomics models by
  extracting comprehensive and representative features. However, CNNs are limited
  in their ability to learn global features within an entire volume. In this study,
  we propose a Transformer-based model for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS)
  in OPSCC patients, called TransRP. TransRP consists of a CNN encoder to extract
  rich PET/CT image features, a Transformer encoder to learn global context features,
  and a fully connected network to incorporate clinical data for RFS prediction. We
  investigated three different methods for combining clinical features into TransRP.
  The experiments were conducted using the public HECKTOR 2022 challenge dataset,
  which includes pretreatment PET/CT scans, Gross Tumor Volume masks, clinical data,
  and RFS for OPSCC patients. The dataset was split into a test set (n = 120) and
  a training set (n = 362) for five-fold cross-validation. The results show that TransRP
  achieved the highest test concordance index of 0.698 (an improvement > 2%) in RFS
  prediction compared to several state-of-the-art clinical and CNN-based methods.
  In addition, we found that incorporating clinical features with image features obtained
  from the Transformer encoder performed better than using the Transformer encoder
  to extract features from both clinical and image features. The code for this study
  is available at (anonymized temporarily for review).
