title: Whole brain radiomics for clustered federated personalization in brain tumor
  segmentation
abstract: Federated learning and its application to medical image segmentation have
  recently become a popular research topic. This training paradigm suffers from statistical
  heterogeneity between participating institutionsâ€™ local datasets, incurring convergence
  slowdown as well as potential accuracy loss compared to classical training. To mitigate
  this effect, federated personalization emerged as the federated optimization of
  one model per distribution. We propose a novel personalization algorithm tailored
  to the feature shift induced by the usage of different scanners and acquisition
  parameters by different institutions. This method is the first to account for both
  inter and intra-institution feature shifts (multiple scanners used in a single institution).
  It is based on the computation, within each centre, of a series of radiomic features
  capturing the global texture of each 3D image volume, followed by a clustering analysis
  pooling all feature vectors transferred from the local institutions to the central
  server. Each computed clustered decentralized dataset (potentially including data
  from different institutions) then serves to finetune a global model obtained through
  classical federated learning. We validate our approach on the Federated Brain Tumor
  Segmentation 2022 Challenge dataset (FeTS2022).
