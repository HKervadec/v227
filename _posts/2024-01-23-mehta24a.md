title: Evaluating the Fairness of Deep Learning Uncertainty Estimates in Medical Image
  Analysis
abstract: 'Although deep learning (DL) models have shown great success in many medical
  image analysis tasks, deployment of the resulting models into real clinical contexts
  requires: (1) that they exhibit robustness and fairness across different sub-populations,
  and (2) that the confidence in DL model predictions be accurately expressed in the
  form of uncertainties. Unfortunately, recent studies have indeed shown significant
  biases in DL models across demographic subgroups (e.g., race, sex, age) in the context
  of medical image analysis, indicating a lack of fairness in the models. Although
  several methods have been proposed in the ML literature to mitigate a lack of fairness
  in DL models, they focus entirely on the absolute performance between groups without
  considering their effect on uncertainty estimation. In this work, we present the
  first exploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases
  across subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance,
  and their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive experiments
  on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion classification, (ii)
  brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimerâ€™s disease clinical score regression.
  Our results indicate that popular ML methods, such as data-balancing and distributionally
  robust optimization, succeed in mitigating fairness issues in terms of the model
  performances for some of the tasks. However, this can come at the cost of poor uncertainty
  estimates associated with the model predictions. This tradeoff must be mitigated
  if fairness models are to be adopted in medical image analysis.'
