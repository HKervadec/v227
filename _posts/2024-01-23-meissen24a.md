title: 'Robust Detection Outcome: A Metric for Pathology Detection in Medical Images'
abstract: Detection of pathologies is a fundamental task in medical imaging and the
  evaluation of algorithms that can perform this task automatically is crucial. However,
  current object detection metrics for natural images do not reflect the specific
  clinical requirements in pathology detection sufficiently. To tackle this problem,
  we propose Robust Detection Outcome (RoDeO); a novel metric for evaluating algorithms
  for pathology detection in medical images, especially in chest X-rays. RoDeO evaluates
  different errors directly and individually, and reflects clinical needs better than
  current metrics. Extensive evaluation on the ChestX-ray8 dataset shows the superiority
  of our metrics compared to existing ones. We released the code at [https://github.com/FeliMe/RoDeO](https://github.com/FeliMe/RoDeO)
  and published RoDeO as pip package ($rodeometric$).
