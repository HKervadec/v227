title: 'MEDIMP: 3D Medical Images and clinical Prompts for renal transplant representation
  learning'
abstract: Renal transplantation emerges as the most effective solution for end-stage
  renal disease. Occurring from complex causes, a substantial risk of transplant chronic
  dysfunction persists and may lead to graft loss. Medical imaging plays a substantial
  role in renal transplant monitoring in clinical practice. However, graft supervision
  is multi-disciplinary, notably joining nephrology, urology, and radiology, while
  identifying robust biomarkers from such high-dimensional and complex data for prognosis
  is challenging. In this work, taking inspiration from the recent success of Large
  Language Models (LLMs), we propose MEDIMP – Medical Images and clinical Prompts
  – a model to learn meaningful multi-modal representations of renal transplant Dynamic
  Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE MRI) by incorporating structural
  clinicobiological data after translating them into text prompts. MEDIMP is based
  on contrastive learning from joint text-image paired embeddings to perform this
  challenging task. Moreover, we propose a framework that generates medical prompts
  using automatic textual data augmentations from LLMs. Our goal is to learn meaningful
  manifolds of renal transplant DCE MRI, interesting for the prognosis of the transplant
  or patient status (2, 3, and 4 years after the transplant), fully exploiting the
  limited available multi-modal data most efficiently. Extensive experiments and comparisons
  with other renal transplant representation learning methods with limited data prove
  the effectiveness of MEDIMP in a relevant clinical setting, giving new directions
  toward medical prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/leomlck/MEDIMP.
