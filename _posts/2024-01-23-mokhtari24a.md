title: Interpretable histopathology-based prediction of disease relevant features
  in Inflammatory Bowel Disease biopsies using weakly-supervised deep learning
abstract: Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are the two main Inflammatory
  Bowel Disease (IBD) types. We developed interpretable deep learning models to identify
  histolog- ical disease features for both CD and UC using only endoscopic labels.
  We explored fine- tuning and end-to-end training of two state-of-the-art self-supervised
  models for predicting three different endoscopic categories (i) CD vs UC (AUC=0.87),
  (ii) normal vs lesional (AUC=0.81), (iii) low vs high disease severity score (AUC=0.80).
  With the support of a pathologist, we explored the relationship between endoscopic
  labels, model predictions and histological evaluations qualitatively and quantitatively
  and identified cases where the pathologist’s descriptions of inflammation were consistent
  with regions of high attention. In parallel, we used a model trained on the Colon
  Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) dataset to predict and explore 6 cell
  populations. We observed consistency between areas enriched with the predicted immune
  cells in biopsies and the pathologist’s feedback on the attention maps. Finally,
  we identified several cell level features indicative of disease severity in CD and
  UC. These models can enhance our understanding about the pathology behind IBD and
  can shape our strategies for patient stratification in clinical trials.
