title: 'Know Your Space: Inlier and Outlier Construction for Calibrating Medical OOD
  Detectors'
abstract: We focus on the problem of producing well-calibrated out-of-distribution
  (OOD) detectors, in order to enable safe deployment of medical image classifiers.
  Motivated by the difficulty of curating suitable calibration datasets, synthetic
  augmentations have become highly prevalent for inlier/outlier specification. While
  there have been rapid advances in data augmentation techniques, this paper makes
  a striking finding that the space in which the inliers and outliers are synthesized,
  in addition to the type of augmentation, plays a critical role in calibrating OOD
  detectors. Using the popular energy-based OOD detection framework, we find that
  the optimal protocol is to synthesize latent-space inliers along with diverse pixel-space
  outliers. Based on empirical studies with multiple medical imaging benchmarks, we
  demonstrate that our approach consistently leads to superior OOD detection ($15%
  - 35%$ in AUROC) over the state-of-the-art in a variety of open-set recognition
  settings.
