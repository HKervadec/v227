title: 'SVD-DIP: Overcoming the Overfitting Problem in DIP-based CT Reconstruction'
abstract: The deep image prior (DIP) is a well-established unsupervised deep learning
  method for image reconstruction; yet it is far from being flawless. The DIP overfits
  to noise if not early stopped, or optimized via a regularized objective. We build
  on the regularized fine-tuning of a pretrained DIP, by adopting a novel strategy
  that restricts the learning to the adaptation of singular values. The proposed SVD-DIP
  uses ad hoc convolutional layers whose pretrained parameters are decomposed via
  the singular value decomposition. Optimizing the DIP then solely consists in the
  fine-tuning of the singular values, while keeping the left and right singular vectors
  fixed. We thoroughly validate the proposed method on real-measured Î¼CT data of a
  lotus root as well as two medical datasets (LoDoPaB and Mayo). We report significantly
  improved stability of the DIP optimization, by overcoming the overfitting to noise.
