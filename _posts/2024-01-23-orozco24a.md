title: Amortized Normalizing Flows for Transcranial Ultrasound with Uncertainty Quantification
abstract: We present a novel approach to transcranial ultrasound computed tomography
  that utilizes normalizing flows to improve the speed of imaging and provide Bayesian
  uncertainty quantification. Our method combines physics-informed methods and data-driven
  methods to accelerate the reconstruction of the final image. We make use of a physics-informed
  summary statistic to incorporate the known ultrasound physics with the goal of compressing
  large incoming observations. This compression enables efficient training of the
  normalizing flow and standardizes the size of the data regardless of imaging configurations.
  The combinations of these methods results in fast uncertainty-aware image reconstruction
  that generalizes to a variety of transducer configurations. We evaluate our approach
  with in silico experiments and demonstrate that it can significantly improve the
  imaging speed while quantifying uncertainty. We validate the quality of our image
  reconstructions by comparing against the traditional physics-only method and also
  verify that our provided uncertainty is calibrated with the error.
