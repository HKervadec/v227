title: Prior Guided 3D Medical Image Landmark Localization
abstract: Accurate detection of 3D landmarks is critical for evaluating and characterizing
  anatomical features and performing preoperative diagnostic screening. However, detecting
  3D landmarks can be challenging due to the local structural homogeneity of medical
  images. To address this issue, physicians often annotate multiple landmarks in a
  single slice, particularly when estimating 3D distance or volume. In this study,
  we present a prior guided coarse-to-fine framework for efficient and accurate 3D
  medical landmark detection; we make use of the prior information that in specific
  settings physicians annotate multiple landmarks on a same slice. The coarse stage
  uses coordinate regression on downsampled 3D images to maintain the structural relationships
  across different landmarks. The fine stage categorizes landmarks as correlated and
  independent landmarks based on their annotation prior. For independent landmarks,
  we train multiple models to capture local features and ensure reliable local predictions.
  For correlated landmarks, we mimic the manual annotation process and propose a correlated
  landmark detection model that merges information from various patches to query key
  slices and identify correlated landmarks. Our method is extensively evaluated on
  two datasets, exhibiting superior performance with an average detection error of
  respective 3.29 mm and 2.13 mm.
