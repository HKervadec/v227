title: Addressing Chest Radiograph Projection Bias in Deep Classification Models
abstract: Deep learning-based models are widely used for disease classification in
  chest radiographs. This exam can be performed in one of two projections (posteroanterior
  or anteroposterior), depending on the direction that the X-ray beam travels through
  the body. Since projection visibly affects the way anatomical structures appear
  in the scans, it may introduce bias in classifiers, especially when spurious correlations
  between a given disease and a projection occur. This paper examines the influence
  of chest radiograph projection on the performance of deep learning-based classification
  models and proposes an approach to mitigate projection-induced bias. Results show
  that a DenseNet-121 model is better at classifying images from the most representative
  projection in the data set, suggesting that projection is taken into account by
  the classifier. Moreover, this model can classify chest X-ray projection better
  than any of the fourteen radiological findings considered, without being explicitly
  trained for that task, putting it at high risk for projection bias. We propose a
  label-conditional gradient reversal framework to make the model insensitive to projection,
  by forcing the extracted features to be simultaneously good for disease classification
  and bad for projection classification, resulting in a framework with reduced projection-induced
  bias.
