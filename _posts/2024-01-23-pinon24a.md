title: One-Class SVM on siamese neural network latent space for Unsupervised Anomaly
  Detection on brain MRI White Matter Hyperintensities
abstract: Anomaly detection remains a challenging task in neuroimaging when little
  to no supervision is available and when lesions can be very small or with subtle
  contrast. Patch-based representation learning has shown powerful representation
  capacities when applied to industrial or medical imaging and outlier detection methods
  have been applied successfully to these images. In this work, we propose an unsupervised
  anomaly detection (UAD) method based on a latent space constructed by a siamese
  patch-based auto-encoder and perform the outlier detection with a One-Class SVM
  training paradigm tailored to the lesion detection task in multi-modality neuroimaging.
  We evaluate performances of this model on a public database, the White Matter Hyperintensities
  (WMH) challenge and show in par performance with the two best performing state-of-the-art
  methods reported so far.
