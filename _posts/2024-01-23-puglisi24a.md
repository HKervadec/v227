title: 'DeepBrainPrint: A Novel Contrastive Framework for Brain MRI Re-Identification'
abstract: Recent advances in MRI have led to the creation of large datasets. With
  the increase in data volume, it has become difficult to locate previous scans of
  the same patient within these datasets (a process known as re-identification). To
  address this issue, we propose an AI-powered medical imaging retrieval framework
  called DeepBrainPrint, which is designed to retrieve brain MRI scans of the same
  patient. Our framework is a semi-self-supervised contrastive deep learning approach
  with three main innovations. First, we use a combination of self-supervised and
  supervised paradigms to create an effective brain fingerprint from MRI scans that
  can be used for real-time image retrieval. Second, we use a special weighting function
  to guide the training and improve model convergence. Third, we introduce new imaging
  transformations to improve retrieval robustness in the presence of intensity variations
  (i.e. different scan contrasts), and to account for age and disease progression
  in patients. We tested DeepBrainPrint on a large dataset of T1-weighted brain MRIs
  from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on a synthetic dataset
  designed to evaluate retrieval performance with different image modalities. Our
  results show that DeepBrainPrint outperforms previous methods, including simple
  similarity metrics and more advanced contrastive deep learning frameworks.
