title: A deep learning method trained on synthetic data for digital breast tomosynthesis
  reconstruction
abstract: 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an X-ray imaging modality enabling
  the reconstruction of 3D volumes of breasts. DBT is mainly used for cancer screening,
  and is intended to replace conventional mammography in the coming years. However,
  DBT reconstructions are impeded by several types of artefacts induced by the geometry
  of the device itself, degrading the image quality and limiting its resolution along
  the thickness of the compressed breast. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based
  pipeline to address the DBT reconstruction problem, focusing on the removal of sparse-view
  and limited-angle artefacts. Specifically, this procedure is composed of two steps:
  a classic reconstruction algorithm is first applied on normalised projections, then
  a deep neural network is tasked with erasing the artefacts present in the obtained
  volumes. A major difficulty to solve our problem is the lack of real conditions
  artefact-free data. To overcome this complication, we resort to a new dataset comprised
  of synthetic breast texture phantoms. We then show that our training method and
  database strategy are promising to tackle the problem as they improve the informational
  value of planes orthogonal to the detector, which are not currently used by radiologists
  due to their poor quality. Eventually, we assess the impact of removing the bias
  components from the network and using stacks of slices as inputs, with regard to
  the generalisation ability of our approach on both synthetic and clinical data.'
