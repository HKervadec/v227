title: Improving Segmentation of Objects with Varying Sizes in Biomedical Images using
  Instance-wise and Center-of-Instance Segmentation Loss Function
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel two-component loss for biomedical image
  segmentation tasks called the Instance-wise and Center-of-Instance (ICI) loss, a
  loss function that addresses the instance imbalance problem commonly encountered
  when using pixel-wise loss functions such as the Dice loss. The Instance-wise component
  improves the detection of small instances or blobs" in image datasets with both
  large and small instances. The Center-of-Instance component improves the overall
  detection accuracy. We compared the ICI loss with two existing losses, the Dice
  loss and the blob loss, in the task of stroke lesion segmentation using the ATLAS
  R2.0 challenge dataset from MICCAI 2022. Compared to the other losses, the ICI loss
  provided a better balanced segmentation, and significantly outperformed the Dice
  loss with an improvement of $1.7-3.7%$ and the blob loss by $0.6-5.0%$ in terms
  of the Dice similarity coefficient on both validation and test set, suggesting that
  the ICI loss is a potential solution to the instance imbalance problem.
