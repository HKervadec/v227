title: Bi-parametric prostate MR image synthesis using pathology and sequence-conditioned
  stable diffusion
abstract: We propose an image synthesis mechanism for multi-sequence prostate MR images
  conditioned on text, to control lesion presence and sequence, as well as to generate
  paired bi-parametric images conditioned on images e.g. for generating diffusion-weighted
  MR from T2-weighted MR for paired data, which are two challenging tasks in pathological
  image synthesis. Our proposed mechanism utilises and builds upon the recent stable
  diffusion model by proposing image-based conditioning for paired data generation.
  We validate our method using 2D image slices from real suspected prostate cancer
  patients. The realism of the synthesised images is validated by means of a blind
  expert evaluation for identifying real versus fake images, where a radiologist with
  4 years experience reading urological MR only achieves 59.4% accuracy across all
  tested sequences (where chance is 50%). For the first time, we evaluate the realism
  of the generated pathology by blind expert identification of the presence of suspected
  lesions, where we find that the clinician performs similarly for both real and synthesised
  images, with a 2.9 percentage point difference in lesion identification accuracy
  between real and synthesised images, demonstrating the potentials in radiological
  training purposes. Furthermore, we also show that a machine learning model, trained
  for lesion identification, shows better performance (76.2% vs 70.4%, statistically
  significant improvement) when trained with real data augmented by synthesised data
  as opposed to training with only real images, demonstrating usefulness for model
  training.
