title: 'OFDVDnet: A Sensor Fusion Approach for Video Denoising in Fluorescence-Guided
  Surgery'
abstract: Many applications in machine vision and medical imaging require the capture
  of images from a scene with very low radiance, which may result in very noisy images
  and videos. An important example of such an application is the imaging of fluorescently-labeled
  tissue in fluorescence-guided surgery. Medical imaging systems, especially when
  intended to be used in surgery, are designed to operate in well-lit environments
  and use optical filters, time division, or other strategies that allow the simultaneous
  capture of low radiance fluorescence video and a well-lit visible light video of
  the scene. This work demonstrates video denoising can be dramatically improved by
  utilizing deep learning together with motion and textural cues from the noise-free
  video.
