title: 'Multi PILOT: Feasible Learned Multiple Acquisition Trajectories For Dynamic
  MRI'
abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is known to be a powerful and reliable
  technique for the dynamic imaging of internal organs and tissues, making it a leading
  diagnostic tool. A major difficulty in using MRI in this setting is the relatively
  long acquisition time (and, hence, increased cost) required for imaging in high
  spatio-temporal resolution, leading to the appearance of related motion artifacts
  and decrease in resolution. Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques have become a common
  tool to reduce MRI acquisition time by subsampling images in the $k$-space according
  to some acquisition trajectory. Several studies have particularly focused on applying
  deep learning techniques to learn these acquisition trajectories in order to attain
  better image reconstruction, rather than using some predefined set of trajectories.
  To the best of our knowledge, learning acquisition trajectories has been only explored
  in the context of static MRI. In this study, we consider acquisition trajectory
  learning in the dynamic imaging setting. We design an end-to-end pipeline for the
  joint optimization of multiple per-frame acquisition trajectories along with a reconstruction
  neural network, and demonstrate improved image reconstruction quality in shorter
  acquisition times. The code for reproducing all experiments will accompany the paper.
