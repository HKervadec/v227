title: Reproducibility of the Methods in Medical Imaging with Deep Learning.
abstract: Concerns about the reproducibility of deep learning research are more prominent
  than ever, with no clear solution in sight. The Medical Imaging with Deep Learning
  (MIDL) conference has made advancements in employing empirical rigor with regards
  to reproducibility by advocating open access, and recently also recommending authors
  to make their code public—both aspects being adopted by the majority of the conference
  submissions. We have evaluated all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between
  2018 and 2022 using established, but adjusted guidelines addressing the reproducibility
  and quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing repositories
  and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps traceability, but
  the quality of the repositories shows room for improvement in every aspect. Merely
  22% of all submissions contain a repository that was deemed repeatable using our
  evaluations. From the commonly encountered issues during the evaluations, we propose
  a set of guidelines for machine learning-related research for medical imaging applications,
  adjusted specifically for future submissions to MIDL. We presented our results to
  future MIDL authors who were eager to continue an open discussion on the topic of
  code reproducibility.
