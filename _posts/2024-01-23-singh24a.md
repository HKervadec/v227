title: Data Consistent Deep Rigid MRI Motion Correction
abstract: 'Motion artifacts are a pervasive problem in MRI, leading to misdiagnosis
  or mischaracterization in population-level imaging studies. Current retrospective
  rigid intra-slice motion correction techniques jointly optimize estimates of the
  image and the motion parameters. In this paper, we use a deep network to reduce
  the joint image-motion parameter search to a search over rigid motion parameters
  alone. Our network produces a reconstruction as a function of two inputs: corrupted
  k-space data and motion parameters. We train the network using simulated, motion-corrupted
  k-space data generated from known motion parameters. At test-time, we estimate unknown
  motion parameters by minimizing a data consistency loss between the motion parameters,
  the network-based image reconstruction given those parameters, and the acquired
  measurements. Intra-slice motion correction experiments on simulated and realistic
  2D fast spin echo brain MRI achieve high reconstruction fidelity while retaining
  the benefits of explicit data consistency-based optimization.'
