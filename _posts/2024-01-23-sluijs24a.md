title: Exploring Image Augmentations for Siamese Representation Learning with Chest
  X-Rays
abstract: Image augmentations are quintessential for effective visual representation
  learning across self-supervised learning techniques. While augmentation strategies
  for natural imaging have been studied extensively, medical images are vastly different
  from their natural counterparts. Thus, it is unknown whether common augmentation
  strategies employed in Siamese representation learning generalize to medical images
  and to what extent. To address this challenge, in this study, we systematically
  assess the effect of various augmentations on the quality and robustness of the
  learned representations. We train and evaluate Siamese Networks for abnormality
  detection on chest X-Rays across three large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert and VinDr-CXR).
  We investigate the efficacy of the learned representations through experiments involving
  linear probing, fine-tuning, zero-shot transfer, and data efficiency. Finally, we
  identify a set of augmentations that yield robust representations that generalize
  well to both out-of-distribution data and diseases, while outperforming supervised
  baselines using just zero-shot transfer and linear probes by up to 20%.
