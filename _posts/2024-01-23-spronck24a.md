title: 'nnUNet meets pathology: Bridging the gap for application to whole slide images
  and computational biomarkers'
abstract: Image segmentation is at the core of many tasks in medical imaging, including
  the engineering of computational biomarkers. While the self-configuring nnUNet framework
  for image segmentation tasks completely shifted the state-of-the-art in the radiology
  field, it has never been adapted to overcome its limitations for application on
  the pathology domain. Our study showcases the potential of nnUNet in computational
  pathology and bridges the gap that currently exists in utilizing nnUNet for pathology
  applications. Our proposed nnUNet for pathology framework has demonstrated its significance
  and potential to shift the state-of-the-art in the computational pathology field,
  as seen from the exceptional first-place segmentation ranking on the TIGER challengeâ€™s
  experimental leaderboard 1. Our framework includes critical hyperparameter adjustments
  and pathology-specific color augmentations, as well as an essential WSI inference
  pipeline and a novel inference uncertainty approach that proves helpful for biomarker
  development. We release the code of our accurate and workflow-friendly segmentation
  tool to promote and foster growth within the computational pathology community.
