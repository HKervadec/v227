title: 'Tumor Budding T-cell Graphs: Assessing the Need for Resection in pT1 Colorectal
  Cancer Patients'
abstract: Colon resection is often the treatment of choice for colorectal cancer (CRC)
  patients. However, especially for minimally invasive cancer, such as pT1, simply
  removing the polyps may be enough to stop cancer progression. Different histopathological
  risk factors such as tumor grade and invasion depth currently found the basis for
  the need for colon resection in pT1 CRC patients. Here, we investigate two additional
  risk factors, tumor budding and lymphocyte infiltration at the invasive front, which
  are known to be clinically relevant. We capture the spatial layout of tumor buds
  and T-cells and use graph-based deep learning to investigate them as potential risk
  predictors. Our pT1 Hotspot Tumor Budding T-cell Graph (pT1-HBTG) dataset consists
  of 626 tumor budding hotspots from 575 patients. We propose and compare three different
  graph structures, as well as combinations of the node labels. The best-performing
  Graph Neural Network architecture is able to increase specificity by 20% compared
  to the currently recommended risk stratification based on histopathological risk
  factors, without losing any sensitivity. We believe that using a graph-based analysis
  can help to assist pathologists in making risk assessments for pT1 CRC patients,
  and thus decrease the number of patients undergoing potentially unnecessary surgery.
  Both the code and dataset are made publicly available.
