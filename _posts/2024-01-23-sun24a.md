title: Inherently Interpretable Multi-Label Classification Using Class-Specific Counterfactuals
abstract: Interpretability is essential for machine learning algorithms in high-stakes
  application fields such as medical image analysis. However, high-performing black-box
  neural networks do not provide explanations for their predictions, which can lead
  to mistrust and suboptimal human-ML collaboration. Post-hoc explanation techniques,
  which are widely used in practice, have been shown to suffer from severe conceptual
  problems. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, current explanation techniques
  do not perform adequately in the multi-label scenario, in which multiple medical
  findings may co-occur in a single image. We propose Attri-Net, an inherently interpretable
  model for multi-label classification. Attri-Net is a powerful classifier that provides
  transparent, trustworthy, and human-understandable explanations. The model first
  generates class-specific attribution maps based on counterfactuals to identify which
  image regions correspond to certain medical findings. Then a simple logistic regression
  classifier is used to make predictions based solely on these attribution maps. We
  compare Attri-Net to five post-hoc explanation techniques and one inherently interpretable
  classifier on three chest X-ray datasets. We find that Attri-Net produces high-quality
  multi-label explanations consistent with clinical knowledge and has comparable classification
  performance to state-of-the-art classification models.
