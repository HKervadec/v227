title: 'Image2SSM: Localization-aware Deep Learning Framework for Statistical Shape
  Modeling Directly from Images'
abstract: Statistical Shape Modelling (SSM) is an effective tool for quantitatively
  analyzing anatom- ical populations. SSM has benefitted largely from advances in
  deep learning where statis- tical representations of anatomies (e.g., point distribution
  models or PDMs) are inferred directly from images, alleviating the need for a time-consuming
  and expensive workflow of anatomy segmentation, shape registration, and model optimization.
  Nonetheless, to date, existing deep learning methods do not consider the rigid pose
  transformation of shapes or anatomy of interest. They also require a tight bounding
  box to be defined over the image of anatomy-of-interest before feeding the image
  to the deep network for network training and inference. In this paper, we propose
  a deep learning framework that simultaneously detects and segments the anatomy of
  interest, estimate the rigid transformation with respect to the population mean
  (average) using a spatial transformer, and estimates the corresponding statistical
  representation of that anatomy, all directly from unsegmented 3D image without the
  need for any additional supervision. Furthermore, we leverage the segmentation task
  to provide an attention model for the sub-network that estimates shape representation,
  giving more accurate shape statistics for shape analysis.
