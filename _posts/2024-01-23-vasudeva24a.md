title: 'GeoLS: Geodesic Label Smoothing for Image Segmentation'
abstract: 'Smoothing hard-label assignments has emerged as a popular strategy in training
  discriminative models. Nevertheless, most existing approaches are typically designed
  for classification tasks, ignoring underlying properties of dense prediction problems,
  such as medical image segmentation. First, these strategies often ignore the spatial
  relations between a given pixel and its neighbours. And second, the image context
  associated with each label is overlooked, which can convey important information
  about potential errors or ambiguities in the segmentation masks. To address these
  limitations, we propose in this work geodesic label smoothing (GeoLS), which integrates
  image information into the label smoothing process by leveraging the geodesic distance
  transform of the images. As the resulting label assignment is based on the computed
  geodesic map, class-wise relationships in the soft-labels are better modeled, as
  it considers image gradients at the boundary of two or more categories. Furthermore,
  spatial pixel-wise relationships are captured in the geodesic distance transform,
  integrating richer information than resorting to the Euclidean distance between
  pixels. We evaluate our method on two publicly available segmentation benchmarks
  and compare them to popular segmentation loss functions that directly modify the
  standard hard-label assignments. The proposed geodesic label smoothing improves
  the segmentation accuracy over existing soft-labeling strategies, demonstrating
  the validity of integrating image information into the label smoothing process.
