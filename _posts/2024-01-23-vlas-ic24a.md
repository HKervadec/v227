title: Estimating Uncertainty in PET Image Reconstruction via Deep Posterior Sampling
abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important functional medical imaging
  technique often used in the evaluation of certain brain disorders, whose reconstruction
  problem is ill-posed. The vast majority of reconstruction methods in PET imaging,
  both iterative and deep learning, return a single estimate without quantifying the
  associated uncertainty. Due to ill-posedness and noise, a single solution can be
  misleading or inaccurate. Thus, providing a measure of uncertainty in PET image
  reconstruction can help medical practitioners in making critical decisions. This
  paper proposes a deep learning-based method for uncertainty quantification in PET
  image reconstruction via posterior sampling. The method is based on training a conditional
  generative adversarial network whose generator approximates sampling from the posterior
  in Bayesian inversion. The generator is conditioned on reconstruction from a low-dose
  PET scan obtained by a conventional reconstruction method and a high-quality magnetic
  resonance image and learned to estimate a corresponding standard-dose PET scan reconstruction.
  We show that the proposed model generates high-quality posterior samples and yields
  physically-meaningful uncertainty estimates.
