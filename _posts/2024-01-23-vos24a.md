title: Calibration techniques for node classification using graph neural networks
  on medical image data
abstract: Miscalibration of deep neural networks (DNNs) can lead to unreliable predictions
  and hinder their use in clinical decision-making. This miscalibration is often caused
  by overconfident probability estimates. Calibration techniques such as model ensembles,
  regularization terms, and post-hoc scaling of the predictions can be employed to
  improve the calibration performance of DNNs. In contrast to DNNs, graph neural networks
  (GNNs) tend to exhibit underconfidence. In this study, we investigate the efficacy
  of calibration techniques developed for DNNs when applied to GNNs trained on medical
  image data, and compare the calibration performance of binary and multiclass node
  classification on a benchmark dataset and a medical image dataset. We find that
  post-hoc methods using Platt scaling or Temperature scaling, or methods that add
  a regularization term to the loss function during training are most effective to
  improve calibration. Our results further indicate that these calibration techniques
  are more effective for multiclass classification tasks compared to binary classification
  tasks.
