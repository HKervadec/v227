title: Self-Supervised CSF Inpainting for Improved Accuracy Validation of Cortical
  Surface Analyses
abstract: Accuracy validation of cortical thickness measurement is a difficult problem
  due to the lack of ground truth data. To address this need, many methods have been
  developed to synthetically induce gray matter (GM) atrophy in an MRI via deformable
  registration, creating a set of images with known changes in cortical thickness.
  However, these methods often cause blurring in atrophied regions, and cannot simulate
  realistic atrophy within deep sulci where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obscured
  or absent. In this paper, we present a solution using a self-supervised inpainting
  model to generate CSF in these regions and create images with more plausible GM/CSF
  boundaries. Specifically, we introduce a novel, 3D GAN model that incorporates patch-based
  dropout training, edge map priors, and sinusoidal positional encoding, all of which
  are established methods previously limited to 2D domains. We show that our framework
  significantly improves the quality of the resulting synthetic images and is adaptable
  to unseen data with fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that our resulting dataset
  can be employed for accuracy validation of cortical segmentation and thickness measurement.
