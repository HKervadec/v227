title: 'MProtoNet: A Case-Based Interpretable Model for Brain Tumor Classification
  with 3D Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging'
abstract: Recent applications of deep convolutional neural networks in medical imaging
  raise concerns about their interpretability. While most explainable deep learning
  applications use post hoc methods (such as GradCAM) to generate feature attribution
  maps, there is a new type of case-based reasoning models, namely ProtoPNet and its
  variants, which identify prototypes during training and compare input image patches
  with those prototypes. We propose the first medical prototype network (MProtoNet)
  to extend ProtoPNet to brain tumor classification with 3D multi-parametric magnetic
  resonance imaging (mpMRI) data. To address different requirements between 2D natural
  images and 3D mpMRIs especially in terms of localizing attention regions, a new
  attention module with soft masking and online-CAM loss is introduced. Soft masking
  helps sharpen attention maps, while online-CAM loss directly utilizes image-level
  labels when training the attention module. MProtoNet achieves statistically significant
  improvements in interpretability metrics of both correctness and localization coherence
  (with a best activation precision of $0.713\pm0.058$) without human-annotated labels
  during training, when compared with GradCAM and several ProtoPNet variants. The
  source code is available at https://github.com/aywi/mprotonet.
