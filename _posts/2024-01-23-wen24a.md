title: A Robust Mean Teacher Framework for Semi-Supervised Cell Detection in Histopathology
  Images
abstract: Cell detection in histopathology images facilitates clinical diagnosis,
  and deep learning methods have been applied to the detection problem with substantially
  improved performance. However, cell detection methods based on deep learning usually
  require a large number of annotated training samples, which are costly and time-consuming
  to obtain, and it is desirable to develop methods where detection networks can be
  adequately trained with only a few annotated training samples. Since unlabeled data
  is much less expensive to obtain, it is possible to address this problem with semi-supervised
  learning, where abundant unlabeled data is combined with the limited annotated training
  samples for network training. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised object
  detection method for cell detection in histopathology images, which is based on
  and improves the mean teacher framework. In standard mean teacher, the detection
  results on unlabeled data given by the teacher model can be noisy, which may negatively
  impact the learning of the student model. To address this problem, we propose to
  suppress the noise in the detection results of the teacher model by mixing the unlabeled
  training images with labeled training images of which the ground truth detection
  results are available. In addition, we propose to further incorporate a loss term
  that is robust to noise when the the student model learns from the teacher model.
  To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on a publicly available
  dataset for multi-class cell detection, and the experimental results show that our
  method improves the performance of cell detection in histopathology images in the
  semi-supervised setting.
