title: Vision-Language Modelling For Radiological Imaging and Reports In The Low Data
  Regime
abstract: 'This paper explores training medical vision-language models (VLMs) – where
  the visual and language inputs are embedded into a common space – with a particular
  focus on scenarios where training data is limited, as is often the case in clinical
  datasets. We explore several candidate methods to improve low-data performance,
  including: (i) adapting generic pre-trained models to novel image and text domains
  (i.e. medical imaging and reports) via unimodal self-supervision; (ii) using local
  (e.g. GLoRIA) & global (e.g. InfoNCE) contrastive loss functions as well as a combination
  of the two; (iii) extra supervision during VLM training, via: (a) image- and text-only
  self-supervision, and (b) creating additional positive image-text pairs for training
  through augmentation and nearest-neighbour search. Using text-to-image retrieval
  as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of these methods with variable sized
  training datasets of paired chest X-rays and radiological reports. Combined, they
  significantly improve retrieval compared to fine-tuning CLIP, roughly equivalent
  to training with $10\times$ the data. A similar pattern is found in the downstream
  task classification of CXR-related conditions with our method outperforming CLIP
  and also BioVIL, a strong CXR VLM benchmark, in the zero-shot and linear probing
  settings. We conclude with a set of recommendations for researchers aiming to train
  vision-language models on other medical imaging modalities when training data is
  scarce. To facilitate further research, we will make our code and models publicly
  available.'
