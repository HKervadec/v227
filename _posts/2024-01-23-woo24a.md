title: 'Semantic Segmentation of 3D Medical Images Through a Kaleidoscope: Data from
  the Osteoarthritis Initiative'
abstract: While there have been many studies on using deep learning for medical image
  analysis, the lack of manually annotated data remains a challenge in training a
  deep learning model for segmentation of medical images. This work shows how the
  kaleidoscope transform (KT) can be applied to a 3D convolutional neural network
  to improve its generalizability when the training set is extremely small. In this
  study, the KT was applied to a context aggregation network (CAN) for semantic segmentation
  of anatomical structures in knee MR images. In the proposed model, KAN3D, the input
  image is rearranged into a batch of downsampled images (KT) before the convolution
  operations, and then the voxels are rearranged back to their original positions
  (inverse KT) after the convolution operations to produce the predicted segmentation
  mask for the input image. Compared to the CAN3D (without the KT), the KAN3D was
  able to reduce overfitting without data augmentation while maintaining a fast training
  and inference time. The paper discusses the observed advantages and disadvantages
  of KAN3D.
