title: 'MedSegDiff: Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Model'
abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has recently become one of the hottest
  topics in computer vision. Its image generation applications, such as Imagen, Latent
  Diffusion Models, and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated impressive generation
  capabilities, which have sparked extensive discussions in the community. Furthermore,
  many recent studies have found DPM to be useful in a variety of other vision tasks,
  including image deblurring, super-resolution, and anomaly detection. Inspired by
  the success of DPM, we propose MedSegDiff, the first DPM-based model for general
  medical image segmentation tasks. To enhance the step-wise regional attention in
  DPM for medical image segmentation, we propose Dynamic Conditional Encoding, which
  establishes state-adaptive conditions for each sampling step. Additionally, we propose
  the Feature Frequency Parser (FF-Parser) to eliminate the negative effect of high-frequency
  noise components in this process. We verify the effectiveness of MedSegDiff on three
  medical segmentation tasks with different image modalities, including optic cup
  segmentation over fundus images, brain tumor segmentation over MRI images, and thyroid
  nodule segmentation over ultrasound images. Our experimental results show that MedSegDiff
  outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a considerable performance gap, demonstrating
  the generalization and effectiveness of the proposed model.
