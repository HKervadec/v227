title: Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable Filters
abstract: 'Incorporating either rotation equivariance or scale equivariance into CNNs
  has proved to be effective in improving modelsâ€™ generalization performance. However,
  jointly integrating rotation and scale equivariance into CNNs has not been widely
  explored. Digital histology imaging of biopsy tissue can be captured at arbitrary
  orientation and magnification and stored at different resolutions, resulting in
  cells appearing in different scales. When conventional CNNs are applied to histopathology
  image analysis, the generalization performance of models is limited because 1) a
  part of the parameters of filters are trained to fit rotation transformation, thus
  decreasing the capability of learning other discriminative features; 2) fixed-size
  filters trained on images at a given scale fail to generalize to those at different
  scales. To deal with these issues, we propose the Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable
  Filter (RSESF), which incorporates steerable filters and scale-space theory. The
  RSESF contains copies of filters that are linear combinations of Gaussian filters,
  whose direction is controlled by directional derivatives and whose scale parameters
  are trainable but constrained to span disjoint scales in successive layers of the
  network. Extensive experiments on two gland segmentation datasets demonstrate that
  our method outperforms other approaches, with much fewer trainable parameters and
  fewer GPU resources required. The source code is available at: https://github.com/ynulonger/RSESF.'
