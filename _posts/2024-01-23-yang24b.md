title: Incomplete learning of multi-modal connectome for brain disorder diagnosis
  via modal-mixup and deep supervision
abstract: Recently, the study of multi-modal brain networks has dramatically facilitated
  the efficiency in brain disorder diagnosis by characterizing multiple types of connectivity
  of brain networks and their intrinsic complementary information. Despite the promising
  performance achieved by multi-modal technologies, most existing multi-modal approaches
  can only learn from samples with complete modalities, which wastes a considerable
  amount of mono-modal data. Otherwise, most existing data imputation approaches still
  rely on a large number of samples with complete modalities. In this study, we propose
  a modal-mixup data imputation method by randomly sampling incomplete samples and
  synthesizing them into complete data for auxiliary training. Moreover, to mitigate
  the noise in the complementary information between unpaired modalities in the synthesized
  data, we introduce a bilateral network with deep supervision for improving and regularizing
  mono-modal representations with disease-specific information. Experiments on the
  ADNI dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for disease classification
  in terms of different rates of samples with complete modalities.
