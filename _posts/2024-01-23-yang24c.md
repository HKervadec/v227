title: Toward Unpaired Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Structured
  Semantic Consistency
abstract: 'Integrating multi-modal data to promote medical image analysis has recently
  gained great attention. This paper presents a novel scheme to learn the mutual benefits
  of different modalities to achieve better segmentation results for unpaired multi-modal
  medical images. Our approach tackles two critical issues of this task from a practical
  perspective: (1) how to effectively learn the semantic consistencies of various
  modalities (e.g., CT and MRI), and (2) how to leverage the above consistencies to
  regularize the network learning while preserving its simplicity. To address (1),
  we leverage a carefully designed External Attention Module (EAM) to align semantic
  class representations and their correlations of different modalities. To solve (2),
  the proposed EAM is designed as an external plug-and-play one, which can be discarded
  once the model is optimized. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
  method on two medical image segmentation scenarios: (1) cardiac structure segmentation,
  and (2) abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Extensive results show that the proposed
  method outperforms its counterparts by a wide margin.'
