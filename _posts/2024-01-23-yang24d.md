title: Trainable Prototype Enhanced Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image
  Classification
abstract: Digital pathology based on whole slide images (WSIs) plays a key role in
  cancer diagnosis and clinical practice. Due to the high resolution of the WSI and
  unavailability of patch level annotations, WSI classification is usually formulated
  as a weakly supervised problem, which relies on multiple instance learning (MIL)
  based on patches of a WSI. In this paper, we aim to learn an optimal patch-level
  feature space by integrating prototype learning with MIL. To this end, we develop
  a Trainable Prototype enhanced deep MIL (TPMIL) framework for weakly supervised
  WSI classification. In contrast to the conventional methods which rely on a certain
  number of selected patches for feature space refinement, we softly cluster all the
  instances by allocating them to their corresponding prototypes. Additionally, our
  method is able to reveal the correlations between different tumor subtypes through
  distances between corresponding trained prototypes. More importantly, TPMIL also
  enables to provide a more accurate interpretability based on the distance of the
  instances from the trained prototypes which serves as an alternative to the conventional
  attention score-based interpretability. We test our method on two WSI datasets and
  it achieves a new SOTA.
