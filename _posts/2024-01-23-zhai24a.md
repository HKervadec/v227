title: Intra- and Inter-Cellular Awareness for 3D Neuron Tracking and Segmentation
  in Large-Scale Connectomics
abstract: Currently, most state-of-the-art pipelines for 3D micro-connectomic reconstruction
  deal with neuron over-segmentation, agglomeration and subcellular compartment (nuclei,
  mitochondria, synapses, etc.) detection separately. Inspired by the proofreading
  consensus of experts, we established a paradigm to acquire priori knowledge of cellular
  characteristics and ultrastructures, as well as determine the connectivity of neural
  circuits simultaneously. Following this novel paradigm, we were keen to bring the
  Intra- and Inter-Cellular Awareness back when Tracking and Segmenting neurons in
  connectomics. Our proposed method (II-CATS) utilizes few-shot learning techniques
  to encode the internal neurite representation and its learnable components, which
  could significantly impact neuron tracings. We further go beyond the original expected
  run length (ERL) metric by focusing on biological constraints (bERL) or spanning
  from the nucleus to spines (nERL). With the evaluation of these metrics, we perform
  typical experiments on multiple electron microscopy datasets on diverse animals
  and scales. In particular, our proposed method is naturally suitable for tracking
  neurons that have been identified by staining.
