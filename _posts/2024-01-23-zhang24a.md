title: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Joint Temporal Image and Sensitivity Map Reconstruction
  via Linear Latent Space
abstract: Fast spin-echo (FSE) pulse sequences for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
  offer important imaging contrast in clinically feasible scan times. T2-shuffling
  is widely used to resolve temporal signal dynamics in FSE acquisitions by exploiting
  temporal correlations via linear latent space and a predefined regularizer. However,
  predefined regularizers fail to exploit the incoherence especially for 2D acquisitions.Recent
  self-supervised learning methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions by learning
  a regularizer from undersampled data without a standard supervised training data
  set. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a self supervised learning
  framework to learn a regularizer constrained on a linear latent space which improves
  time-resolved FSE images reconstruction quality. Additionally, in regimes without
  groundtruth sensitivity maps, we propose joint estimation of coil-sensitivity maps
  using an iterative reconstruction technique. Our technique functions is in a zero-shot
  fashion, as it only utilizes data from a single scan of highly undersampled time
  series images. We perform experiments on simulated and retrospective in-vivo data
  to evaluate the performance of the proposed zero-shot learning method for temporal
  FSE reconstruction. The results demonstrate the success of our proposed method where
  NMSE and SSIM are significantly increased and the artifacts are reduced.
