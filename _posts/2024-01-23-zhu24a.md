title: Inherent Consistent Learning for Accurate Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: 'Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has attracted much attention
  in recent years because of the high cost of medical image annotations. In this paper,
  we propose a novel Inherent Consistent Learning (ICL) method, aims to learn robust
  semantic category representations through the semantic consistency guidance of labeled
  and unlabeled data to help segmentation. In practice, we introduce two external
  modules, namely Supervised Semantic Proxy Adaptor (SSPA) and Unsupervised Semantic
  Consistent Learner (USCL) that is based on the attention mechanism to align the
  semantic category representations of labeled and unlabeled data, as well as update
  the global semantic representations over the entire training set. The proposed ICL
  is a plug-and-play scheme for various network architectures, and the two modules
  are not involved in the testing stage. Experimental results on three public benchmarks
  show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art, especially when
  the number of annotated data is extremely limited. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhuye98/ICL.git'
