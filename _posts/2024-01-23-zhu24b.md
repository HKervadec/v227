title: 'SegPrompt: Using Segmentation Map as a Better Prompt to Finetune Deep Models
  for Kidney Stone Classification'
abstract: Recently, deep learning has produced encouraging results for kidney stone
  classification using endoscope images. However, the shortage of annotated training
  data poses a severe problem in improving the performance and generalization ability
  of the trained model. It is thus crucial to fully exploit the limited data at hand.
  In this paper, we propose SegPrompt to alleviate the data shortage problems by exploiting
  segmentation maps from two aspects. First, SegPrompt integrates segmentation maps
  to facilitate classification training so that the classification model is aware
  of the regions of interest. The proposed method allows the image and segmentation
  tokens to interact with each other to fully utilize the segmentation map information.
  Second, we use the segmentation maps as prompts to tune the pretrained deep model,
  resulting in much fewer trainable parameters than vanilla finetuning. We perform
  extensive experiments on the collected kidney stone dataset. The results show that
  SegPrompt can achieve an advantageous balance between the model fitting ability
  and the generalization ability, eventually leading to an effective model with limited
  training data.
